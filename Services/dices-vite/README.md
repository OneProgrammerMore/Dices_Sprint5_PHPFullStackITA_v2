# Dices! Too Many Dices!

This is the AJAX Application for the 5th Sprint of the Bootcamp PHP Full Stack Developer by IT Academy Barcelona.
Well... it is not the first version... the first version was just a simple AJAX application using AJAX with no design at all... sadly my design capabilities are not quite good...

But now... it was Dices! A lot of dices!!! And they move it move it with the implementation of a react component hook using threejs.

If you want to see it you will need to install the project in your own system... sadly it is not quiet easy for no programmers... but luckily you have the next section to help ;)

## Installation:

Requirements:
- Docker Compose Software
- Browser (Chromium works better than Firefox for some stuff... unlucky "has" CSS selector...)
- A little of time
- A lot of patience
- A coffee always helps... or are you a tea person?

Steps:
1. In the root folder of the project run:
```
docker-compose up
```
2. Wait a little while docker builds all the containers and there is not more annoying text appearing on the terminal. (Good time for the coffee break ;) )

3. Go to your browser and go to one of these IPs:
  - localhost:83
  - 127.0.0.1:83

  Or the next URLs
  - http://127.0.0.1:83
  - http://localhost:83

  *Assure that the browser is not redirecting you to the httpS url, some browser do this nowadays for user's security, quite annoying stuff for hackers who sniff the traffic. (HTTPS not supported with current docker configuration)

4. You should now be able to browse the web... But remember...

**IMPORTANT**
- DO NOT enter your real email to the platform, emails are not validated neither stored in any foreign database and nobody cares about them in that project. But who knows... if no needed... it is better to do not give you real information ;) (If the email is already taken just try another one)
- USE an easy password that do NOT is any other that you use! I know... you will need to use another password than your email's password "password"... but sometimes people need to think a little haha ^^ (If the password is already taken use another one. - Just kidding haha)
